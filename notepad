Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App:
The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements.
Example Code

<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.

HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the main element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.

img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. An element without a closing tag is known as a void element.

Add an anchor element that links to https://freecatphotoapp.com. At this point, the link wonâ€™t show up in the preview. A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. target="\_blank" opens the linked document in a new tab or window.

Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the present content from the future content.
The section element is used to define sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. It is a semantic element that helps with SEO and accessibility.

When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, it's implied that you're starting a new subsection.

The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.
Nest the image you just added within a figure element.
A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element.
Here is an example of a figcaption element with the caption of A cute cat:
Example Code

<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
  <figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption>
</figure>

To place emphasis on a specific word or phrase, you can use the em element. by wrapping it in an emphasis <em> element.
The strong element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent. by wrapping it in a <strong> element.

list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed.

The form element is used to get information from a user like their name, email, and other details.
The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent.
Here is an example of a form element with an action attribute:
Example Code

<form action="/submit-url"></form>
In the example, action="/submit-url" tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.
The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are a void element and do not need closing tags.
Nest an input element in the form element.
In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted.
To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

Add a button element with the text Submit below the input element. The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's action attribute.
However, relying on default behavior may cause confusion. Add the type attribute with the value submit to the button to make it clear that it is a submit button.

both input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines.

you can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.
Here is an example of a radio button with the option of cat:
Example Code
<input type="radio"> cat

label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers).
Here is an example of a label element with a radio button:
Example Code
<label><input type="radio"> cat</label>
In the example, clicking on the word "cat" will also select the radio button.

To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value.
If you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its name and value attributes. Since your radio buttons do not have a value attribute, the form data will include indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful when you have multiple buttons.
Add a value attribute to both radio buttons. For convenience, set the button's value attribute to the same value as its id attribute.

The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.
The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.

Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. The input element with a type attribute set to checkbox creates a checkbox.

There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute.
<input id="loving" type="checkbox">
<label for="loving">Loving</label>

Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are name / value attribute pairs. While the value attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page.

In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it.
Here is an example of a radio button with the checked attribute:
Example Code
<input checked type="radio" name="meal" value="breakfast"> Breakfast

The footer element is used to define a footer for a document or section. A footer typically contains information about the author of the document, copyright data, links to terms of use, contact information, and more.

All page content elements that should be rendered to the page go inside the body element.
However, other important information goes inside the head element.
The head element is used to contain metadata about the document, such as its title, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the page.
The title element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page.

Notice that the entire contents of the page are nested within an html element. The html element is the root element of an HTML page and wraps all content on the page.
You can also specify the language of your page by adding the lang attribute to the html element.
Add the lang attribute with the value en to the opening html tag to specify that the language of the page is English.

All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.

<!DOCTYPE html> tells browsers that the document is an HTML5 document which is the latest version of HTML.

You can set browser behavior by adding meta elements in the head. Here's an example:
Example Code
<meta attribute="value">
Inside the head element, nest a meta element with an attribute named charset. Set to the value to utf-8 which tells the browser how to encode characters for the page.
Note that the meta element is a void element.
